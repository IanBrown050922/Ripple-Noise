# Ripple-Noise
Python module for generating images using a unique kind of procedural noise/texture I came up with.

The name is "Ripple Noise" because the noise generation method is inspired by ripples in water.

This repository includes the module (ripple_noise.py), demo code, and some example images generated with the demo code.
